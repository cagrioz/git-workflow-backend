INSERT INTO Workflow (workflow_id, workflow_name, workflow_description)
VALUES (1, 'feature', '<p><b>The Feature Branch Workflow</b> is a flexible and efficient workflow for managing and collaborating on software development projects. 
It is based on the use of feature branches, which allow developers to work on new features or bug fixes in isolation from the main codebase.</p>
<p><b>Why should you learn Feature Branch Workflow?</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Promotes collaboration and code review</li>
  <li>Supports continuous integration and delivery</li>
  <li>Provides a clear and consistent way to manage and organize code changes</li>
  <li>Addresses the issues of conflicts and merge errors in basic git workflow.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Beneficial for:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Developers who want to improve their collaboration and code review skills</li>
  <li>Teams that want to implement continuous integration and delivery practices</li>
  <li>Projects that require a consistent and organized approach to managing code changes</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Usage:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Create a new feature branch for each new feature or bug fix</li>
  <li>Share the feature branch with others for feedback and review</li>
  <li>Test and integrate code changes on the feature branch before merging into the main branch</li>
  <li>The Feature Branch Workflow can be used in conjunction with other workflows like Git Flow.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Advantages:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>Suitable for <b>Continuous Delivery</b> and <b>Continuous Integration</b></li>
    <li>A more straightforward alternative to <b>Git Flow</b></li>
    <li>Optimal for maintaining a single version in production</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Disadvantages:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>The production code can become unreliable</li>
    <li>Not ideal for release planning</li>
    <li>Does not address deployment, environments, releases and issues</li>
    <li>Not suitable for maintaining multiple versions in production.</li>
